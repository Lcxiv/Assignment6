"A different error message, finally some progress!"

This sorting algorithm programs takes for input a file containing floats or a random sequence of floats based on the user input. Then, it will calculate the time for each algorithm to sort the array and prompt the user if they want to export their results, and if they want to try another option.
It was a fun little assignment that showed the other side of programming (performance) that we don't necessarily think at first when we start doing that kind of stuff. I implemented the five algorithms by helping myself from the book and web sources that would explain how quickSort and mergeSort work and are implemented. I added a few options to make it less "basic" as well.
Thanks for this semester!

Problems:
After answering if the user wants to export the results, it may take a long time to display the loop again.
